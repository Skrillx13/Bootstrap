When building Projects with Bootstrap, we always have several recommendations to get the most out of it, as well as improving your efficency. If you would like to add a personal recommendation, please [submit an issue](https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0?si=lrZ3BhmiRO734-tv) on our GitHub.

## Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators are incredibly popular for being incredibly easy to use, and deploy as they are essentially static files. Most Static Site generators also have a large community, and there's a good chance the community has a Bootstrap-based theme availabale.

Here's a list of some nice Static Site Generators:

### Hugo

*Additional Resources: [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io)*

Bootstraps Documentation is actually built with Hugo! Hugo is the fastest way to render HTML, with reloads taking less than a second, even on large sites. 

We recommend Hugo for:

- Being able to write in Markdown.
- Being able to create layouts easily, as well as using Bootstrap in those layouts.
- It's blazingly fast speed.

### Jekyll

*Additional Resources: [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com), [Liquid Templating Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)*

While Jekyll may not be as fast (or as new) as Hugo, it is still a good option for building Static Sites. It's also simpler than Hugo, using Liquid Templates instead of Go Templates.

We recommend Jekyll for:

- Also being able to write in Markdown.
- Having a flexible directory structure, which is well organized.
- Being extremelly simple to learn.

## MKDocs

*Additional Resources: [MKDocs Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org), [MKDocs Bootswatch Theme](https://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/)*

MKDocs is an excellent Static Site Generator for building Project Documentation. MKDocs default theme is also built with Bootstrap, meaning you will have Bootstrap right off the bat when using MKDocs.

We recommend MKDocs for:

- Having tons of features for Project Documentation
- A Bootstrap theme for use off the bat.

## VSCode Extensions
